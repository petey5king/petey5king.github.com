**[Be A Manager](https://medium.com/servant-leadership/3b0e39d87179)**
**[Blog] - 10 Minutes.  Jan 27, 2014**

> Insight in to moving from IC to Manager.  Why would anyone want to take on a manager role?  Management is horrible!  Great quote in here "I've always thought that the hardest and most valuable thing in work is to get a group of smart people to work together toward a common goal."  Take management seriously.  Also talks of a common trend, if you like to help people more than you like to hack on code, management might be for you, and it isn't a walk in the park.

**[Empowering Developers Through Infrastructure](https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/inside-digitalocean-mark-imbriaco/)**
**[Blog] - 10 Minutes.  April, 2014**

> This might seem like an odd link to have listed here, a "press release" for someone joining Digital Ocean, but I feel like it really dives into IC vs Manager in a very subtle way.

> "I think it's typical of engineers to reach a certain level and feel there's really nowhere to go but management. But management is not the continuation of an engineering career, it's really starting over in a new discipline. You can either embrace this truth immediately, which is incredibly rare, or you take the role and rail against it for a while and complain about being in meetings all the time instead of writing code."
