<p />
A new year means new beards to look forward to.  As I sit here waiting for a mysql import to finish it's time to reflect on the new year.
When I really think about it it's been a long year, I can't even remember what I was doing last January.  
<p />

<h4>Last year</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Moved back to Seattle from London, England - never thought I'd move back</li>
  <li>Started a new job moving from infrastructure to operations</li>
  <li>Learned python and wrote a distributed video encoding solution with <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> 
    and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xoreax_Grid_Engine">incredibuild</a></li>
  <li>Learned ruby and wrote <a href="https://github.com/petey5king/bbgcli">my first gem</a></li>
  <li>Learned <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/">Chef!</a></li>
  <li>Learned <a href="http://www.perforce.com/">perforce</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a></li>
  <li>Stopped writing php and perl</li>
  <li><strong>Grew a great beard with 0 trimming for 2 months</strong></li>
  <li>Moved from mostly windows over to mac os/linux</li>
  <li>Learned what the hell *-aas was and started using it</li>
  <li>Found out about <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> - my favorite monitoring solution</li>
  <li>Got my <a href="http://serverfault.com/users/70187/pablo">serverfault</a> score up to 2,224</li>
</ul>

<h4>This year</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Get more involved in open source.  Sharing is caring!  Definitely a restriction from my old job that no longer holds me back.</li>
  <li>Hand in hand with open source, get more community involved.  Server fault a good start but need to get more involed in more aspects of community driven technology.</li>
  <li>Learn rails and improve on ruby and chef.  This is a big one for me.</li>
  <li>Autoscale like a BOSS.</li>
  <li>Ship a game to at least alpha, no matter how crappy graphics(or text based) but it must be fun!</li>
  <li>Do one thing really well.  I'm always so spread apart and that's the way I like it but being an expert has its advantages.</li>
</ul>

<p />

I need to update this further, but as a friend recently told me you must SHIP.  (ABS)
