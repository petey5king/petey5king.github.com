A new year means new beards to look forward to.  As I sit here waiting for a mysql import to finish it's time to reflect on the new year.
When I really think about it it's been a long year, I can't even remember what I was doing last January.  
<p />

<h4>Last year</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Moved back to Seattle from London, England - never thought I'd move back</li>
  <li>Started a new job moving from infrastructure to operations</li>
  <li>Learned python and wrote a distributed video encoding solution with ffmpeg and incredibuild</li>
  <li>Learned ruby and wrote my first gem</li>
  <li>Learned Chef!</li>
  <li>Learned perforce and git</li>
  <li>Stopped writing php and perl</li>
  <li>Grew a great beard with 0 trimming for 2 months</li>
  <li>Moved from mostly windows over to mac os/linux</li>
  <li>Learned what the hell *-aas was and started using it</li>
  <li>Found out about New Relic - my favorite monitoring solution</li>
  <li>Got my serverfault score up to 2,224</li>
</ul>

<h4>This year</h4>

<ul>
  <li>No friggin idea</li>
</ul>

<p />

I need to update this further, but as a friend recently told me you must SHIP.
