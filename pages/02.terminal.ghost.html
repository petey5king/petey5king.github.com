<h3>Help there's a ghost in my terminal!</h3>
</p>
<p>
OOOOoooooooOOoOooooOOOhhhhh.  That's the sound of the ghost in os x lion that continues to reopen my terminal states, even if I've closed them properly.  No I don't want to reconnect to all my existing ssh sessions when I've closed them all.  No I don't want to go back into my dev directory this time!  Please no, no, no HELPPPP HELPPPPPL HEEEHHHLLPPSPE.  Simple trick seems to have done this for me.
